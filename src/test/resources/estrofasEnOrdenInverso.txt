So put your loving hand out
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

I'm just a con about to fade to black
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Just can't make it all alone
I'm fightin' hard to hold my own

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Yeah

Girl, I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Keep browsin' halls
Now the court is yours
Keep walking forward
Keep rockin' dawns
But I keep walkin' on

Ya had it till you took it back
You done gave it away
Like the heart in a trash where you should
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could react
You on a runway track from the good

Why the feel for the need to replace me?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
What we doin'? What we chasin'?

To win my soul
Won't even stand the devil's dance
But I don't know
A broken man

Was hangin' over me
The shadow of my life
I used to be
An empty shell

Only then can I begin to live again
The kind of man you want in the end
Tried so hard to be your man
I need you to understand

And put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

Hey yeah, ratatata
'Cause I don't want to lose you
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'

But I planted that seed, just let me grow
Any time I see you, let me know
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No
So, any time I need ya, let me go

And it would end
But easy come and easy go
I walked away, but you warned me then
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Ridin' high when I was king

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

'Cause I'm beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby
